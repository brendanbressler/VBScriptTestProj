Project Title: Database Management System using VBS and SQL Server Express

Project Overview:
The objective of this project is to develop a Database Management System using SQL Server Express and VBScript (VBS) to maintain a database of customers, contacts, addresses, and orders. The system will provide a menu-driven interface for users to perform various operations such as adding customers, contacts, addresses, deleting records, and managing orders.

Deliverables:

Installation instructions for SQL Server Express.
SQL script file (.sql) to create the necessary database tables.
VBS script file (.vbs) that implements the menu-driven interface and handles the database operations.
Documentation and user guide explaining how to use the system.
Scope of Work:
The scope of work includes the following tasks:
a. Installation:

Provide detailed instructions for installing SQL Server Express.
b. Database Design:

Design the database schema with tables for customers, contacts, addresses, and orders.
Establish appropriate one-to-many relationships between the tables.
c. SQL Script Creation:

Create a .sql file that contains SQL statements to create the required database tables based on the schema design.
d. VBS Script Development:

Develop a VBS script using available online resources that implements the menu-driven interface.
Handle user inputs and outputs to perform various database operations such as adding customers, contacts, addresses, and managing orders.
e. Testing and Debugging:

Perform thorough testing to ensure the system functions correctly, handles errors gracefully, and maintains data integrity.
Debug any issues encountered during the testing phase.
f. Documentation:

Prepare comprehensive documentation that includes installation instructions, system architecture, usage guidelines, and troubleshooting tips.
Assumptions and Dependencies:

The user will have a Windows machine compatible with SQL Server Express.
The user will have basic knowledge of SQL Server Express and VBS scripting.
The required resources for SQL Server Express and VBS scripting will be available.
Any specific hardware or software dependencies will be communicated and addressed prior to the project initiation.
Timeline:

The project timeline is estimated to be [insert estimated duration] from the project initiation date.
The exact timeline will be determined after further discussion and understanding of the project requirements.
Total Dollar Amount: This is just an example so no need for a real number

The total cost for the project will be determined based on the estimated effort, duration, and complexity of the project.
A detailed cost estimate will be provided after a thorough analysis of the project requirements.
Project Management and Communication:

Regular communication will be maintained through [communication channels such as email, meetings, etc.] to discuss progress, address concerns, and provide updates on the project.
Any changes to the project scope or timeline will be discussed and agreed upon by both parties.
Note: This Statement of Work is a high-level description of the project. Detailed discussions and planning will be carried out to refine the requirements, scope, and deliverables before the project commences.
